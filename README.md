# artemis
Artemis is a multi-function chatbot written in node that interfaces with slack. It utilizes natural language processing features to identify user requests and respond to them accordingly.

# ARTEMIS - Auto-Responding Task Execution Made in Slack

## TODO

- Allow Artemis to function across multiple channels / groups with specific functionality to each.
- Allow Artemis functionality to be enabled or disabled on a per channel / group basis.
- Artemis can be trained through the APIAI to expand its capability into natural language understanding.
